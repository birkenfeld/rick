I have made my TPK program available on
  http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html
and I have no objection if you or other people with INTERCAL sites
add it to their collection. If you have time to check it out
(at least a little), I think you'll see that it introduces a few
new hacks that work only on INTERCAL, including DON'T RESUME #1
and REINSTATE NEXTING. Also a way to avoid simple branching by using
an array: Suppose you want to set x<-y if and only if z is true.
Then keep x in ;X SUB#1 and "shadow x" in ;X SUB#2 and convert
z to .Z = 1 if true, 2 if false; then set ;X SUB .Z <- y (no branching).
If you have time to look at only a little bit of the program,
I recommend the last two subroutines, "CMP" (which is teleprinter
code for 23438) and "TIX" (29904). Someday I'll publish clues about
what is going on, in my Fun and Games book; the code is filled with
jokes that only a true hacker can appreciate.... and I think I've
used every non-newfangled feature of the language.
