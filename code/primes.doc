primes.i is a simple program for printing out a list of prime numbers.
It has an outer loop variable .11 and an inner loop variable .13, both
of which start at #3 and advance through odd numbers.  .13 contains the
numbers being tested as possible divisors of .11, which is the number
being tested for primality.  Each time through the inner loop a 16-bit
division with remainder routine (2030) is called to divide .11 by .13.
If .13 is greater than the quotient then .11 is known to be prime and
is printed out.  If the remainder is #0, on the other hand, then .11
is known to be composite and the inner loop is terminated prematurely.

The termination test for the outer loop is controlled by statement (22),
which tests to see if the high bit of (.11-#1)/#2 is set.  You can
modify this statement to test some other bit if you want the program
to terminate sooner.  It took over 17 hours on a Sparc 1 for this
program to find all 16-bit primes.
