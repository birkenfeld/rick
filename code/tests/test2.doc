David Moews wrote this about test2.i:

The following program reads in two numbers and then prints their product.
It consists of a trivial calling program followed by a cleaned-up version
of a portion of the INTERCAL subroutine library.  (Only a portion of
the INTERCAL subroutine library is present in the posted manual, and
that portion is full of typos.)
