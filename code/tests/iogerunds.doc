You might want to try the following program (I've just been hacking this up,

But that's the power of intercal...) This program will ask for a number
and might print it then, except that it doesn't ask the first time but
                                              _ 
assumes ONE TWO THREE. Oh and it never prints    but just exits in case that
would've been printed (I did my best to make that part as unreadable as
possible. did it work? :)
