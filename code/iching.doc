Notes on iching1.i and iching2.i:

Both versions (1 and 2) use the same code for generating lines of the
hexagram, a simulation of the "coin oracle" method.  (Six separate
unconditional calls to (1020) were used since I thought lumping them
all together by starting .1 at #6 would be disrespectful.)
Implementation of the yarrow-stalk oracle is left as an exercise for
the student.  Note that in converting the numbers from the program into
the lines of a hexagram, one should work from the bottom up.  The last
number gives the top line.

The traditional sequence of the hexagrams does not have a consistent
mathematical explanation.  Version 2 of the program therefore uses a
lookup table to determine the number of each hexagram in sequence.  The
six lines are printed as in version 1, then the sequence number for the
hexagram, and finally the sequence number for the derived hexagram
obtained by replacing moving lines (9 and 6) by their opposites.
